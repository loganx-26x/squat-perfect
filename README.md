# Squat Perfect: A Computer Vision Application

Welcome to **Squat Perfect**, a computer vision application designed to count squats and provide real-time feedback to users. My ultimate goal was to help users perfect their squat form and technique.

**Squat Perfect** is not just a squat counter. It's a personal fitness assistant that encourages users to improve their squats by going deeper.
